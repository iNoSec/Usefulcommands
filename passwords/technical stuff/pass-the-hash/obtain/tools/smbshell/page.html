This tool was written by Nicolas Pouvesle, from Tenable Security. It's a precompiled<br/>
NASL script that can be used with Nessus 3 and above, to interact with a<br/>
remote Windows host via simple shell. It gives the tester the ability to navigate through<br/>
the remote SMB shares via FTP. It also gives her the ability to read and enumerate SMB<br/>
registry. In addition to executing queries, it allows the attacker to add and remove users<br/>
and groups on the system, as well as overtaking the control of the system over remote<br/>
services (TenableSecurity, 2006). </body></html>
