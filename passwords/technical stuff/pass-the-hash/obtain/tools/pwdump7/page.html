<title>Pwdump7</title>
</head><body>pwdump7 was written by Andres Tarasco Acuna (Acuna, 2009). It differs from<br/>
other hash dump tools by having its own file system driver, which allows attackers to<br/>
dump the registry hives of both SYSTEM and SAM directly from disk.<br/>
Once the hives are dumped, the system key will be obtained from the SYSTEM<br/>
hive and then be used to decrypt LM and NTLM hashes. During the tests, pwdump7.exe<br/>
was able to retrieve the hashes from all Windows platforms tested</body></html>
