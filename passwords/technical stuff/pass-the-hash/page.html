<title>Pass-the-Hash</title>
</head><body>Password hashes are equivalent to clear-text passwords (Johansson, 2009).<br/>
<br/>
Pass-the-hash attacks are usually directed against Windows systems, however<br/>
they can be found in other systems, for example vulnerable web applications (SANS,<br/>
2008).<br/>
<br/>
In Windows, pass-the-hash attack depends on the Single Sign-On (SSO)<br/>
functionality in authentication protocols like NTLM and Kerberos (Scambray &amp;<br/>
McClure, 2008). With SSO, users can enter their passwords once to be able to use<br/>
resources they have been given rights to, without prompting them for their passwords<br/>
again. This requires the system to have the users' credentials cached within the system<br/>
(see 2.1.3). By replacing this credential with a password hash (or a ticket) further<br/>
authentication will be done using this hash instead of the original credential (Scambray &amp;<br/>
McClure, 2008). <br/>
<br/>
Password hashes are loaded into the Local Security Authority Subsystem (Lsass).<br/>
Lsass runs as the executable %SystemRoot%\System32\Lsass.exe, which is responsible<br/>
for user authentication, among other things (Russinovich, Solomon, &amp; Ionescu, 2009). </body></html>
