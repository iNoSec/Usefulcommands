</head><body>The LM hash is only used in conjunction with the LM authentication protocol.<br/>
With its debut in Windows 3.11, this protocol was one of Microsoftâ€™s first and as a result,<br/>
it carried many security problems with it [Melber 2004]. In earlier versions of Windows, the LM hash is typically stored and transmitted by default. However, in Windows Vista and versions above, the LM hash is not stored by default, nor is it used by default during network authentication (Johansson, 2009). Instead, the newer versions use the NTLMv2 hash as the default authentication method (Scambray &amp; McClure, 2008). <br/>
<br/>
One of the more notable issues pertains to how LM transmits the password hash in cleartext across the network thus making it prone to capture [CIAC 2008]. After many years of service, Microsoft finally released an operating system (Vista and Server 2008) where this was disabled by default [Grutzmacher 2008].<br/>
All Windows OSs prior to Windows Server 2003 send both LM and NTLM responses by default. In Windows Server 2003 only the NTLM response is sent by default, while the LM response field is mostly unused (Johansson, 2009). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Both LM and NTLM are very similar, but differ mainly in the hash used to compute the response. LM and NTLM are used for authentication in workgroups. They are also used in a domain environment if either the client, or the server is not a domain member, or if a resource within the domain is accessed by its IP address instead of its NetBIOS or DNS name. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The LM hash is only used in conjunction with the LM authentication protocol, while the NT hash serves duty in the NTLM, NTLMv2, and Kerberos authentication protocols [Microsoft 2007].When a user performs an interactive login, the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process is called upon to store the hashes in memory [Johansson 2005].<br/>
