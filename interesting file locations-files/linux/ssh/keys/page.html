</head><body>You've got the root user to try but if you've managed some user enumeration then you might be able to check their home directories as well. The files you are looking for are all in the .ssh directory:<br/>
authorized_keys<br/>
id_rsa<br/>
id_rsa.keystore<br/>
id_rsa.pub<br/>
known_hosts<br/>
