<title>screen</title>
</head><body>Screen is a bit easier to set up for ethical-hijacking. All you need to do is modify the users' &quot;screenrc&quot; file, make it so they can't modify it and add the lines:<br/>
<br/>
multiuser on<br/>
acladd root<br/>
<br/>
and, of course, set up their profiles to launch screen at login. With these conditions in place, all you need to do, as root, to watch a user session is to type the following at the command line:<br/>
<br/>
host # screen -x user<br/>
<br/>
If you're not sure who's on, or one user has multiple screens open:<br/>
<br/>
host # screen -x<br/>
<br/>
with no specific argument should let you know </body></html>
