<title>tmux</title>
</head><body>Here is a list of a few basic tmux commands:<br/>
<br/>
  Ctrl+b &quot; — split pane horizontally.<br/>
  Ctrl+b % — split pane vertically.<br/>
  Ctrl+b arrow key — switch pane.<br/>
  Hold Ctrl+b, don’t release it and hold one of the arrow keys — resize pane.<br/>
  Ctrl+b c — (c)reate a new window.<br/>
  Ctrl+b n — move to the (n)ext window.<br/>
  Ctrl+b p — move to the (p)revious window.<br/>
<br/>
Other thing worth knowing is that scrolling is enabled by pressing Ctrl+b PgUp/PgDown. In fact, it enables the copy mode, which can also be done by pressing Ctrl+b [. When in copy mode, you can use PgUp/PgDown and arrow keys to scroll through the terminal contents. To (q)uit the copy mode, simply press the q key.<br/>
<br/>
That should do the trick. At least, most of it.<br/>
<br/>

KEY BINDINGS<br/>
  tmux may be controlled from an attached client by using a key combination of a prefix key, ‘C-b’ (Ctrl-b) by<br/>
  default, followed by a command key.<br/>
<br/>
  The default command key bindings are:<br/>
<br/>
     C-b     Send the prefix key (C-b) through to the application.<br/>
     C-o     Rotate the panes in the current window forwards.<br/>
     C-z     Suspend the tmux client.<br/>
     <b>!      Break the current pane out of the window.</b><br/>
     <b>&quot;      Split the current pane into two, top and bottom.</b><br/>
     #      List all paste buffers.<br/>
     <b>$      Rename the current session</b>.<br/>
     <b>%      Split the current pane into two, left and right.</b><br/>
     &amp;      Kill the current window.<br/>
     '      Prompt for a window index to select.<br/>
     <b>(      Switch the attached client to the previous session.</b><br/>
     <b>)      Switch the attached client to the next session.</b><br/>
     <b>,      Rename the current window.</b><br/>

     =      Choose which buffer to paste interactively from a list.<br/>
     ?      List all key bindings.<br/>
     D      Choose a client to detach.<br/>
     L      Switch the attached client back to the last session.<br/>
     [      Enter copy mode to copy text or view the history.<br/>
     ]      Paste the most recently copied buffer of text.<br/>
     c      Create a new window.<br/>

     l      Move to the previously selected window.<br/>
     n      Change to the next window.<br/>

     p      Change to the previous window.<br/>
     q      Briefly display pane indexes.<br/>
     r      Force redraw of the attached client.<br/>
     m      Mark the current pane (see select-pane -m).<br/>
     M      Clear the marked pane.<br/>
     s      Select a new session for the attached client interactively.<br/>
     t      Show the time.<br/>
     w      Choose the current window interactively.<br/>
     x      Kill the current pane.<br/>
     z      Toggle zoom state of the current pane.<br/>
     {      Swap the current pane with the previous pane.<br/>
