<title>chmod human readable</title>
</head><body>If someone else runs the file (ie not root), they will run the file as the user/group who created it (ie look for files created as root. when exec by non root, they will still run as root). <br/>
<br/>
Using it on a directory is slightly different. &quot;Executing&quot; a directory means the possiblity to access anythign in the dirctory (either file or subdir). This is different from read (r) permission on a directory, which allows you ro tread the names of the files/subdirectories. <br/>
<br/>
Using chmod +s on a directory, changes the user/group as which you &quot;execute&quot; the directory. This implie that, whenver a new file or subdir is created, it will &quot;inherit&quot; the group ownership of the parent directory if the &quot;setGID&quot; bit is set. Inheriting the owner is not possible. Ownership of new files/subdirs always belongs to the user who created it. <br/>
<br/>
Using the find command to locate suid and guid files is a common practice to locate candidate programs to uninstall<br/>
IE: you can use the find command to help locate some files that may run with different permissions<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Easy way to add: chmod +rwx (permission)<br/>
Easy way to set: chmod ugo=rwx<br/>
u = user<br/>
g = group<br/>
o = others</body></html>
