The Netwide Assembler (NASM) is an assembler and disassembler for the Intel x86 architecture. It can be used to write 16-bit, 32-bit (IA-32) and 64-bit (x86-64) programs. NASM is considered to be one of the most popular assemblers for Linux.<br/>
<br/>
NASM can output several binary formats including COFF, OMF, a.out, Executable and Linkable Format (ELF), Mach-O and binary file (.bin, binary disk image, used to compile operating systems), though position-independent code is supported only for ELF object files. NASM also has its own binary format called RDOFF.<br/>
<br/>
Also, NASM can create flat binary files, usable to write boot loaders, read-only memory (ROM) images, and in various facets of OS development. NASM can run on non-x86 platforms as a cross assembler, such as PowerPC and SPARC, though it cannot generate programs usable by those machines.<br/>
<br/>
NASM uses a variant of Intel assembly syntax instead of AT&amp;T syntax. It also avoids features such as automatic generation of segment overrides (and the related ASSUME directive) used by MASM and compatible assemblers.<br/>
<br/>
To translate the object files into executable programs, an appropriate linker must be used, such as the <b>Visual Studio &quot;LINK&quot; utility for Windows</b>or <b>ld for Unix</b>-like systems.<br/>
<br/>
nasm -f bin &lt;shellcode.asm&gt;<br/>
nasm -f bin -o payload.bin payload.asm<br/>
nasm -f elf payload.asm; ld -o payload payload.o; objdump -d payload<br/>
<br/>
To assemble a file, you issue a command of the form<br/>
nasm -f &lt;format&gt; &lt;filename&gt; [-o &lt;output&gt;]<br/>
