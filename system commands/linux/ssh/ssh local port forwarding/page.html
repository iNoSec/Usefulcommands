<title>SSH Local Port Forwarding</title>
</head><body>It establishes a SSH connection between the SSH client and the SSH server.<br/>
SSH listens on a local port established when the connection was set up. Any connection<br/>
made to this port is forwarded through the secure SSH tunnel and sent on to a predefined<br/>
remote host and port.<br/>
<br/>
SSH local port forwarding is set up with the following command on the attacker’s<br/>
system:<br/>
<br/>
# ssh -L 80:192.168.128.128:80 user@192.168.112.132<br/>
<br/>
The syntax of the command is<br/>
ssh –L port:destination_host:destination_port username@pivot_host<br/>
<br/>
where port is the local port that listens<br/>
destination_host is the target host IP or hostname,<br/>
destination_port is the port listening on the target host, <br/>
username is the user name on the pivot host,<br/>
pivot_host is the IP address or hostname of the server being used as the pivot point<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Using SSH local port forwarding assumes that SSH server is running on the<br/>
compromised host that will be used for pivoting. If it is not installed or running, then<br/>
activating it depends upon the conditions established in Rules of Engagement for the<br/>
penetration test.</body></html>
