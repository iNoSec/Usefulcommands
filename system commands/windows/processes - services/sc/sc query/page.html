Syntax<br/>
sc [&lt;ServerName&gt;] query [&lt;ServiceName&gt;] [type= {driver | service | all}] [type= {own | share | interact | kernel | filesys | rec | adapt}] [state= {active | inactive | all}] [bufsize= &lt;BufferSize&gt;] [ri= &lt;ResumeIndex&gt;] [group= &lt;GroupName&gt;]<br/>
<br/>
Parameters<br/>
Parameter			Description<br/>
&lt;ServerName&gt;		Specifies the name of the remote server on which the service is located. The name must use the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) format (for example, \\myserver). To run SC.exe locally, omit this parameter.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;ServiceName&gt;		Specifies the service name returned by the getkeyname operation. This query parameter is not used in conjunction with other query parameters (other than ServerName).<br/>
<br/>
type= {driver | service | all}	Specifies what to enumerate. The default value for the first type is service.<br/>
- driver: Specifies that only drivers are enumerated.<br/>
- service: Specifies that only services are enumerated.<br/>
- all: Specifies that both drivers and services are enumerated.<br/>
<br/>
type= {own | share | interact | kernel | filesys | rec | adapt}	Specifies the type of services or type of drivers to be enumerated. The default value for the second type is own.<br/>
- own: Specifies that the service runs in its own process. It does not share an executable file with other services.<br/>
- share: Specifies that the service runs as a shared process. It shares an executable file with other services.<br/>
- interact: Specifies that the service can interact with the desktop, receiving input from users. Interactive services must be run under the LocalSystem account.<br/>
- kernel: Specifies a driver.<br/>
- filesys: Specifies a file system driver.<br/>
<br/>
state= {active | inactive | all}	Specifies the started state of the service to be enumerated. The default state is active.<br/>
- active: Specifies all active services.<br/>
- inactive: Specifies all paused or stopped services.<br/>
- all: Specifies all services.<br/>
<br/>
bufsize= &lt;BufferSize&gt;		Specifies the size (in bytes) of the enumeration buffer. The default buffer size is 1,024 bytes. You should increase the size of the enumeration buffer when the display resulting from a query exceeds 1,024 bytes.<br/>
<br/>
ri= &lt;ResumeIndex&gt;			Specifies the index number at which enumeration is to begin or resume. The default value is 0 (zero). Use this parameter in conjunction with the bufsize= parameter when more information is returned by a query than the default buffer can display.<br/>
<br/>
group= &lt;GroupName&gt;		Specifies the service group to be enumerated. By default, all groups are enumerated (group= &quot;&quot;).<br/>
