<title>Runas</title>
</head><body>Allows a user to run specific tools and programs with different permissions than the user's current logon provides.<br/>
<br/>
Runas is a command-line tool that is built into Windows Vista. To use runas at the command line, open a command prompt, type runas with the appropriate parameters, and then press ENTER.<br/>
<br/>
In the user interface for Windows Vista, the Run asâ€¦ command has been changed to Run as administrator. However, you should rarely have to use the Run as administrator command because Windows Vista will automatically prompt you for an administrator password when it is needed.<br/>
<br/>
For examples of how this command can be used, see Examples.<br/>
<br/>
