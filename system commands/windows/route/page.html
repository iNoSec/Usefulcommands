<title>Route</title>
</head><body>Displays and modifies the entries in the local IP routing table. Used without parameters, route displays help.<br/>
<br/>
Syntax<br/>
route [-f] [-p] [Command [Destination] [mask Netmask] [Gateway] [metric Metric]] [if Interface]]<br/>
<br/>
Parameters<br/>
-f : Clears the routing table of all entries that are not host routes (routes with a netmask of 255.255.255.255), the loopback network route (routes with a destination of 127.0.0.0 and a netmask of 255.0.0.0), or a multicast route (routes with a destination of 224.0.0.0 and a netmask of 240.0.0.0). If this is used in conjunction with one of the commands (such as add, change, or delete), the table is cleared prior to running the command.<br/>
<br/>
-p : When used with the add command, the specified route is added to the registry and is used to initialize the IP routing table whenever the TCP/IP protocol is started. By default, added routes are not preserved when the TCP/IP protocol is started. When used with the print command, the list of persistent routes is displayed. This parameter is ignored for all other commands. Persistent routes are stored in the registry location HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\PersistentRoutes.<br/>
<br/>
Command : Specifies the command you want to run. The following table lists valid commands.<br/>
<br/>
Command			Purpose<br/>
add				Adds a route.<br/>
change			Modifies an existing route.<br/>
delete			Deletes a route or routes.<br/>
print				Prints a route or routes.<br/>
<br/>
Destination : Specifies the network destination of the route. The destination can be an IP network address (where the host bits of the network address are set to 0), an IP address for a host route, or 0.0.0.0 for the default route.<br/>
<br/>
mask Netmask : Specifies the netmask (also known as a subnet mask) associated with the network destination. The subnet mask can be the appropriate subnet mask for an IP network address, 255.255.255.255 for a host route, or 0.0.0.0 for the default route. If omitted, the subnet mask 255.255.255.255 is used. Because of the relationship between the destination and the subnet mask in defining routes, the destination cannot be more specific than its corresponding subnet mask. In other words, there cannot be a bit set to 1 in the destination if the corresponding bit in the subnet mask is a 0.<br/>
<br/>
Gateway : Specifies the forwarding or next hop IP address over which the set of addresses defined by the network destination and subnet mask are reachable. For locally attached subnet routes, the gateway address is the IP address assigned to the interface that is attached to the subnet. For remote routes, available across one or more routers, the gateway address is a directly reachable IP address that is assigned to a neighboring router.<br/>
<br/>
metric Metric : Specifies an integer cost metric (ranging from 1 to 9999) for the route, which is used when choosing among multiple routes in the routing table that most closely match the destination address of a packet being forwarded. The route with the lowest metric is chosen. The metric can reflect the number of hops, the speed of the path, path reliability, path throughput, or administrative properties.<br/>
<br/>
if Interface : Specifies the interface index for the interface over which the destination is reachable. For a list of interfaces and their corresponding interface indexes, use the display of the route print command. You can use either decimal or hexadecimal values for the interface index. For hexadecimal values, precede the hexadecimal number with 0x. When the if parameter is omitted, the interface is determined from the gateway address.<br/>
