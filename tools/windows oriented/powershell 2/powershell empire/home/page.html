Empire<br/>
Empire is a post-exploitation framework that includes a pure-PowerShell2.0 Windows agent, and a pure Python 2.6/2.7 Linux/OS X agent. It is the merge of the previous PowerShell Empire and Python EmPyre projects. The framework offers cryptologically-secure communications and a flexible architecture. On the PowerShell side, Empire implements the ability to run PowerShell agents without needing powershell.exe, rapidly deployable post-exploitation modules ranging from key loggers to Mimikatz, and adaptable communications to evade network detection, all wrapped up in a usability-focused framework. PowerShell Empire premiered at BSidesLV in 2015 and Python EmPyre premeiered at HackMiami 2016.<br/>
<br/>
Empire relies heavily on the work from several other projects for its underlying functionality. We have tried to call out a few of those people we've interacted with heavily here and have included author/reference link information in the source of each Empire module as appropriate. If we have failed to improperly cite existing or prior work, please let us know.<br/>
<br/>
Empire is developed by @harmj0y, @sixdub, @enigma0x3, rvrsh3ll, @killswitch_gui, and @xorrior.<br/>

Contribution Rules<br/>
Contributions are more than welcome! The more people who contribute to the project the better Empire will be for everyone. Below are a few guidelines for submitting contributions.<br/>
<br/>
Submit pull requests to the dev branch. After testing, changes will be merged to master.<br/>
Depending on what you're working on, base your module on ./lib/modules/powershell_template.py or ./lib/modules/python_template.py. Note that for some modules you may need to massage the output to get it into a nicely displayable text format with Out-String.<br/>
Cite previous work in the 'Comments' module section.<br/>
If your script.ps1 logic is large, may be reused by multiple modules, or is updated often, consider implementing the logic in the appropriate data/module_source/* directory and pulling the script contents into the module on tasking.<br/>
Use approved PowerShell verbs for any functions.<br/>
PowerShell Version 2 compatibility is STRONGLY preferred.<br/>
TEST YOUR MODULE! Be sure to run it from an Empire agent before submitting a pull to ensure everything is working correctly.<br/>
For additional guidelines for your PowerShell code itself, check out the PowerSploit style guide.</body></html>
