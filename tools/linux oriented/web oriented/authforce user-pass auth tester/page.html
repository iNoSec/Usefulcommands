<title>AuthForce: User/Pass Auth Tester</title>
</head><body><a href="http://www.divineinvasion.net/authforce">http://www.divineinvasion.net/authforce</a><br/>
Hydra probably better? <br/>
<br/>
Description<br/>
Authforce is an HTTP authentication brute forcer. Using various methods, it attempts brute force username and password pairs for a site. It has the ability to try common username and passwords, username derivations, and common username/password pairs. It is used to both test the security of your site and to prove the insecurity of HTTP authentication based on the fact that users just donâ€™t pick good passwords.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
History<br/>
I made this because I was curious how bad people were at choosing decent passwords. It can also be used to test the security of your site.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Usage<br/>
See the README. You run it, it searches and displays matches.<br/>
