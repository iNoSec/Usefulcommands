GRAUDIT<br/>
<br/>
Graudit is a simple script and signature sets that allows you to find potential <br/>
security flaws in source code using the GNU utility grep. It's comparable to <br/>
other static analysis applications like RATS, SWAAT and flaw-finder while <br/>
keeping the technical requirements to a minimum and being very flexible.<br/>
<br/>
USAGE<br/>
Graudit supports several options and tries to follow good shell practices. For<br/>
a list of the options you can run graudit -h or see below. The simplest way to <br/>
use graudit is;<br/>
graudit &lt;options&gt; /path/to/scan<br/>
<br/>
The following options are available:<br/>
 -A scan ALL files<br/>
 -B don't print banner<br/>
 -c &lt;num&gt; number of lines of context to display, default is 2<br/>
 -d &lt;db&gt; database to use<br/>
 -h prints a short help text<br/>
 -i case in-sensitive search<br/>
 -l lists databases available<br/>
 -L vim friendly lines<br/>
 -v prints version number<br/>
 -x exclude these files (comma seperated list:-x *.js,*.sql)<br/>
 -z supress colors<br/>
 -Z high contrast colors<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DATABASES<br/>
Graudit uses extended regular expressions (POSIX) as it's signatures and comes <br/>
with several databases ready for use. You can extend the existing databases or <br/>
make your own if you require additional signatures.<br/>
<br/>
* All is a combined database of all the databases listed below<br/>
<br/>
* Asp offers basic auditing support for the Active Server Pages languages<br/>
<br/>
* C offers support for the C programming language<br/>
<br/>
* Default is aimed at finding low hanging fruit. It cointains generic rules that <br/>
 should match common vulnerabilites in several languages. However, in order to <br/>
 find additional vulnerabilities for a specific language you should use the <br/>
 language specific databases.<br/>
<br/>
* Dotnet offers basic dot net support<br/>
<br/>
* Jsp basic JSP support.<br/>
<br/>
* Other looks for source comments that could indicate problems<br/>
<br/>
* Perl basic support for perl<br/>
<br/>
* PHP tracks user input and function calls<br/>
<br/>
* Python basic python support<br/>
<br/>
