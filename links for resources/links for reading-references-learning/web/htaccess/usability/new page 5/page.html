<title>Force media downloads
</title>
</head><body>Here is a useful method for delivering multimedia file downloads to your users. Typically, browsers will attempt to play or stream such files when direct links are clicked. With this method, provide a link to a multimedia file and a dialogue box will provide users the choice of saving the file or opening it. Here are a few .htaccess rules demonstrating the technique (edit file types according to your specific needs):<br/>
<br/>
# instruct browser to download multimedia files<br/>
AddType application/octet-stream .avi<br/>
AddType application/octet-stream .mpg<br/>
AddType application/octet-stream .wmv<br/>
AddType application/octet-stream .mp3<br/>
