<title>Important note about redirecting via mod_rewrite
</title>
</head><body>For all redirects using the mod_rewrite directive, it is necessary to have the RewriteEngine enabled. It is common practice to enable the mod_rewrite directive in either the server configuration file or at the top of the site’s root .htaccess file. If the mod_rewrite directive is not included in either of these two places, it should be included as the first line in any code block that utilizes a rewrite function (i.e., mod_rewrite), but only needs to be included once for each .htaccess file. The proper mod_rewrite directive is included here for your convenience, but may or may not also be included within some of the code blocks provided in this article:<br/>
<br/>
# enable rewrite engine<br/>
RewriteEngine on<br/>
Note that it’s fine to include this directive multiple times in the same .htaccess file.</body></html>
