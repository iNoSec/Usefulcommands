<title>More fun with Redirect &amp; RedirectMatch
</title>
</head><body>For redirects that are on the same domain, like when you move a file into a new directory, you can omit the protocol and domain from the destination URI. For example:<br/>
<br/>
# redirect for a single file<br/>
Redirect 301 /old-dir/old-file.html /new-dir/new-file.html<br/>
Here we are redirecting /old-dir/old-file.html to /new-dir/new-file.html on the same domain. So we excluded http://domain.com from the destination URI (compare with other examples in this section).<br/>
<br/>
To redirect multiple files, we can pattern-match using any regex that is necessary. For example, we can use (.*) to match anything (or nothing):<br/>
<br/>
# redirect multiple files<br/>
RedirectMatch 301 /dir/xyz/(.*) http://domain.com/$1<br/>
Here we are using RedirectMatch to match any request for /xyz/ or any file or directory contained in /xyz/. If the request matches, it will be redirected via 301 “Permanent” status code to the new domain. The $1 in this example represents whatever is matched by (.*). So if the requested URI is /dir/xyz/bananaz.php, it will be redirected to http://domain.com/bananaz.php.<br/>
<br/>
To redirect an entire, such that every URL is redirected to the same URL on the new domain, use Redirect:<br/>
<br/>
# redirect all URLs to new domain<br/>
Redirect 301 / http://new-domain.com/<br/>
Alternately, if you want to redirect all requests from the old domain to the same URL on the new domain (e.g., the homepage), we can use RedirectMatch, like so:<br/>
<br/>
# redirect all URLs to same URL<br/>
RedirectMatch 301 / http://new-domain.com/<br/>
Notice the difference: RedirectMatch redirects everything to the same location, whereas Redirect redirects each URL to the same URL on the new domain.<br/>
