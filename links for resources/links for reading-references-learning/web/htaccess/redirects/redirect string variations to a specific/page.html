<title>Redirect string variations to a specific address
</title>
</head><body>For example, if we wanted to redirect any requests containing the character string, perish, to our main page at perishablepress.com, we would replace some-string with perish in the following code block:<br/>
<br/>
# redirect all variations of a specific string<br/>
RewriteRule ^some-string http://www.domain.com/index.php/blog/target [R]<br/>
Here are two other methods for accomplishing string-related mapping tasks:<br/>
<br/>
# map variations to same directory on same server<br/>
AliasMatch ^/director(y|ies) /www/docs/target<br/>
# map variations to same directory on different server<br/>
RedirectMatch ^/[dD]irector(y|ies) http://domain.com<br/>
