</head><body>Apache server software provides distributed (i.e., directory-level) configuration via Hypertext Access files. These .<a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/htaccess.html">htaccess</a>files enable the localized fine-tuning of Apache’s universal system-configuration directives, which are defined in Apache’s main configuration file. The localized .htaccess directives must operate from within a file named .htaccess. The user must have appropriate file permissions to access and/or edit the .htaccess file.<br/>
<br/>
Further, .htaccess file permissions should never allow world write access — a secure permissions setting is “644”, which allows universal read access and user-only write access. Finally, .htaccess rules apply to the parent directory and all subdirectories. Thus to apply configuration rules to an entire website, place the .htaccess file in the site’s root directory.</body></html>
