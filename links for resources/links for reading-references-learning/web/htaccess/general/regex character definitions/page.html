#<br/>
The # instructs the server to ignore the line. used for including comments. each line of comments requires it’s own #. when including comments, it is good practice to use only letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores. this practice will help eliminate/avoid potential server parsing errors.<br/>
[F]<br/>
Forbidden: instructs the server to return a 403 “Forbidden” response to the client.<br/>
[L]<br/>
Last rule: instructs the server to stop rewriting after the preceding directive is processed.<br/>
[N]<br/>
Next: instructs Apache to rerun the rewrite rule until all rewriting directives have been achieved.<br/>
[G]<br/>
Gone: instructs the server to deliver a 410 “Gone” response (indicating that the resource no longer exists.<br/>
[P]<br/>
Proxy: instructs server to handle requests by mod_proxy.<br/>
[C]<br/>
Chain: instructs server to chain the current rule with the previous rule.<br/>
[R]<br/>
Redirect: instructs Apache to issue a redirect, causing the client to request the new content.<br/>
[NC]<br/>
No Case: defines any associated argument as case-insensitive. That is, “NC” = “No Case”.<br/>
[PT]<br/>
Pass Through: instructs mod_rewrite to pass the rewritten URL back to Apache for further processing.<br/>
[OR]<br/>
Or: specifies a logical “or” that ties two expressions together such that either one proving true will cause the associated rule to be applied.<br/>
[NE]<br/>
No Escape: instructs the server to parse output without escaping characters.<br/>
[NS]<br/>
No Subrequest: instructs the server to skip the directive if internal sub-request.<br/>
[QSA]<br/>
Append Query String: directs server to add the query string to the end of the expression (URL).<br/>
[S=x]<br/>
Skip: instructs the server to skip the next “x” number of rules if a match is detected.<br/>
[E=variable:value]<br/>
Environmental Variable: instructs the server to set the environmental variable “variable” to “value”.<br/>
[T=MIME-type]<br/>
Mime Type: declares the mime type of the target resource.<br/>
[]<br/>
Specifies a character class, in which any character within the brackets will be a match. For example, [xyz] will match either an “x”, “y”, or “z”.<br/>
[]+<br/>
Character class in which any combination of items within the brackets will be a match. For example, [xyz]+ will match any number of “x”, “y”, “z”, or any combination of these characters.<br/>
[^]<br/>
Specifies not within a character class. For example, [^xyz] will match any character that is neither “x”, “y”, nor “z”.<br/>
[a-z]<br/>
A dash (-) between two characters within a character class ([]) denotes the range of characters between them. For example, [a-zA-Z] matches all lowercase and uppercase letters from “a” thru “z”.<br/>
a{n}<br/>
Specifies an exact number, n, of the preceding character. For example, x{3} matches “x” exactly three times.<br/>
a{n,}<br/>
Specifies n or more of the preceding character. For example, x{3,} matches “x” three or more times.<br/>
a{n,m}<br/>
Specifies a range of numbers, between n and m, of the preceding character. For example, x{3,7} matches “x” three, four, five, six, or seven times.<br/>
()<br/>
Used to group characters together, thereby considering them as a single unit. For example, (perishable)?press will match “press”, with or without the<br/>
“perishable” prefix.<br/>
^<br/>
Denotes the beginning of a regex (regex = regular expression) test string. That is, begin argument with the proceeding character.<br/>
$<br/>
Denotes the end of a regex (regex = regular expression) test string. That is, end argument with the previous character.<br/>
?<br/>
Declares as optional the preceding character. For example, monzas? will match “monza” or “monzas”, while mon(za)? will match either “mon” or “monza”. That is, x? matches “x” zero or one times.<br/>
!<br/>
Declares negation. For example, !string matches everything except string.<br/>
.<br/>
A dot (or period) indicates any single arbitrary character.<br/>
–<br/>
Instructs “not to” rewrite the URL, as in (.*) - [F].<br/>
+<br/>
Matches one or more of the preceding character. For example, G+ matches “G” one or more times.<br/>
*<br/>
Matches zero or more of the preceding character. For example, you can use .* as a wildcard to match anything (or nothing).<br/>
|<br/>
Declares a logical “or” operator. For example, (x|y) matches “x” or “y”.<br/>
\<br/>
Escapes special characters ( ^ $ ! . * | ). For example, use \. to indicate/escape a literal dot.<br/>
\.<br/>
Indicates a literal dot (escaped).<br/>
/*<br/>
Zero or more slashes.<br/>
.*<br/>
Zero or more arbitrary characters.<br/>
^$<br/>
Defines an empty string.<br/>
.*<br/>
The standard pattern for matching everything (or nothing).<br/>
[^/.]<br/>
Defines one character that is neither a slash nor a dot.<br/>
[^/.]+<br/>
Defines any number of characters which contains neither slash nor dot.<br/>
http://<br/>
This is a literal statement — in this case, the literal character string, http://.<br/>
^domain.*<br/>
Defines a string that begins with the term “domain”, which then may be proceeded by any number of any characters.<br/>
^domain\.com$<br/>
Defines the exact string, “domain.com”.<br/>
-d<br/>
Tests if string is an existing directory.<br/>
-f<br/>
Tests if string is an existing file.<br/>
-s<br/>
