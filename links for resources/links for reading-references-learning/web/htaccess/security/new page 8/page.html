This is how to block unwanted visitors based on the referring domain. You can also save bandwidth by blocking specific file types — such as .jpg, .zip, .mp3, .mpg — from specific referring domains. Simply replace scumbag and wormhole with the offending domains of your choice:<br/>
<br/>
# block visitors referred from indicated domains<br/>
&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;<br/>
	RewriteEngine on<br/>
	RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} scumbag\.com [NC,OR]<br/>
	RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} wormhole\.com [NC,OR]<br/>
	RewriteRule .* - [F]<br/>
&lt;/ifModule&gt;<br/>
