<br/>
Scenario<br/>
Consider you use a service as “assert” in your website assert.mysite.com<br/>
The service is hosted in bitbucket in the URL myassert-example.bitbucket.com<br/>
Bitbucket has stopped this service and you are still using it<br/>
Now hacker can claim the service<br/>
Now, when you visit myassert-example.bitbucket.com you are actually visiting the hackers site<br/>
Hackers now can post a defacement or put an HTML Form and asks users to login (Perform phishing attack)<br/>
<br/>
Prevention<br/>
Attackers generally can claim subdomains with the external services. In this case, you cannot trace back on the attack and it affects a lot. We can find it out with the tools available(Like Knockpy) or go through all of your DNS entries and remove the ones which are active and unused or the ones pointing to the external services which are not in use anymore.<br/>
<br/>
What is Knockpy<br/>
Knockpy is a python tool designed to bruteforce and find the list of Subdomains for a particular Domain. It internally uses a wordlist file which comes with the tool to bruteforce. But, we can also have our own wordlist to bruteforce the domain.<br/>
<br/>
You should visit the subdomain to check whether it is vulnerable or not. your subdomain is vulnerable if you find errors like ‘No such app’.<br/>
